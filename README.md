# SM1-MAS
[Modeling and Simulation](https://fagbesk.sam.sdu.dk/?fag_id=38441) course projects.

# About
The course focused on modeling and simulation of real-world discrete event systems. For example arrival of customers at a [bank](https://github.com/Spiderixius/SM1-MAS/tree/master/Bank) and how to simulate queues and serving times. Bunch of other real life discrete event systems are simulated. 

# How to run
To run these projects you will need [AnyLogic](https://www.anylogic.com/). Once you have AnyLogic running, simply load the .alp file inside AnyLogic.
